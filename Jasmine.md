# Introduction to Jasmine

## What is Unit Testing?

--> Unit Testing is testing individual units of code.
Here unit is the smallest testable part of your code. (function)

--> Why we should write Unit test for our code?
Trust changes you make on existing (already tested) code.

If you don't have unit tests every time when you change the code we need to test manually each page, each feature before you publish

Another reason is Code Quality. the code that is tested is best

Changes occur quickly. If our code is tested we can release the changes vey quickly without breaking
